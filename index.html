                                <p class="project-text">
                                This project was created to simulate the future of autonomous driving for virtual test environments. 
                                The neural network was trained using a genetic algorithm to navigate a virtual car around a track. 
                                The code was written in Java and used the deeplearning4j API for the neural network configurations.
                                This was the first project that I had began without any structural help from a tutor or supervisor,
                                meaning that I had to learn how to implement a neural network, genetic algorithm, and the deeplearning4j API from scratch.
                                The project was a success and the car was able to navigate around the track with a high level of accuracy.
                                <br> <br> 
                                Many skills and techniques were learned during the development of this project, such as how neural networks functioned,
                                how to calculate distances in a 2D space, what inputs to use, and how to train the network using those inputs to achieve
                                the desired output. Once of the key insights that I learned was that the neural network was only as good as the data that
                                was fed to it. 
                                <br> <br> 
                                One such mistake was I inputted the co-ordinates of the nearest walls to the car in each sensor direction.
                                This was completely useful for the neural network, as it was unable to determine the distance between the car and the wall.
                                After fiddling with the code and repeadedly trying to figure out the mistake, I finally realised that instead of giving the 
                                co-ordinates of the wall, I should have given the distance between the car and the wall. This showed me that even very 
                                obvious issues can be overlooked, and that it is important to take a step back and look at the problem from a different angle.
                                <br> <br> 
                                If I were to begin this project again, I would have spent more time researching the deeplearning4j API and further how to implement my own 
                                neural network. I would like to have also added more outputs to the neural network, such as the speed of the car, as the car 
                                was only able to move at a constant speed. 
                                <br> <br> 
                                Another feature I would implement in a better way is how the map is made. The map is currently made using co-ordinates between the
                                start and end of the walls, meaning that the map is not very flexible. I had implemented a function that allowed you to use your
                                mouse to draw the map, but it was not very user friendly and was not very accurate. This meant that expanding or creating
                                new maps were very difficult and time consuming. If I were to do this project again, I would have spent more time researching
                                how to create a map using a more user friendly method, such as using a map editor.
                                <br> <br> 
                                I believe overall this was a very great first project and experience in starting a project in general. One thing I learnt
                                was to add more documentation and create a more structured plan before starting the project as currently the classes and methods
                                are not very well documented and the code is not very structured. This made it very difficult to add new features or fix bugs.
